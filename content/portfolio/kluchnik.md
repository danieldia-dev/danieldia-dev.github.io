Developed as a final team project for the 'Digital Electronics' track of an international educational exchange at the AIEO ‚ÄúPhystech-Lyceum‚Äù of Natural Sciences and Mathematics named after P.L. Kapitza, this project is a complete system for generating secure passwords. It's built on **true physical randomness** to address the vulnerabilities of software-based pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), particularly in the face of emerging quantum computing threats.

The system demonstrates a full-stack approach to a real-world security problem, spanning from low-level hardware interaction and embedded C++ programming to high-level, secure network communication and modern desktop application development in Rust.

### System Architecture

The project consists of two primary components that work together to create a seamless and secure user experience.

#### 1. Embedded TRNG Device (C++ / ESP32)

The core of the system is a custom-built hardware device that generates truly random data.

* **üå™Ô∏è Entropy Harvesting:** Gathers true entropy from unpredictable physical sources, including motion data from an **MPU-6050** accelerometer/gyroscope and electronic noise from oscillator jitter.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Random Number Generation:** Utilizes a motion-controlled 'gated counter' on an **ESP32** microcontroller to process the raw entropy into random bytes.
* **üîí On-Device Encryption:** Secures the generated 128-bit random key on the device itself using **AES-128-CBC** encryption via the `mbedtls` library.
* **üì° Secure Communication:** Hosts its own Wi-Fi Access Point and a TCP server for secure data transmission to the client application. It also features a small OLED screen for a user interface.

#### 2. Desktop Client Application (Rust)

A cross-platform desktop application provides the user interface and final password generation.

* **ü¶Ä Modern & Asynchronous:** Developed in **Rust** with an asynchronous graphical user interface (GUI) using the **Iced** and **Tokio** frameworks.
* **üîó Secure Connection & Decryption:** Connects directly to the hardware device's TCP server, receives the encrypted data, and decrypts the AES key.
* **üì± Password Generation & Display:** Uses the decrypted random key to generate a final, secure password. It displays the password along with a scannable **QR code** for easy use on mobile devices.
* **üé® Custom UI & Remote Control:** Features a full remote control for the hardware device and a custom user interface with switchable light and dark themes.
