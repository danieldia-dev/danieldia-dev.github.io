Hello! I am Daniel Dia 👋

Welcome to my personal space on the web! 

I am a Computer & Communications Engineering (CCE) and Mathematics dual degree student at the American University of Beirut (AUB), driven to apply a strong theoretical foundation to solve complex, real-world problems.

My journey is grounded in a deep fascination with the powerful intersection of mathematics 📈, software 💻, and electrical engineering💡(and quantitative finance 🧠). I am passionate about translating advanced theoretical concepts—from mathematical analysis and linear algebra to information theory—into high-impact applications. 

In addition, I am interested in leveraging dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and numerical methods to create more efficient simulations and algorithmic analyses, especially in the context of finance and computational nonsmooth dynamics.

I believe in principled software engineering: creating software that is not just functional, but also verifiably correct, efficient, and memory-safe. This focus steers my deep interest in languages like Rust and C, foundational systems like the Linux kernel, and the elegance of data structures and algorithms. 

This extends to my work in machine learning and deep Learning, where I focus on building efficient AI with applications in embedded software on microcontrollers. I am currently exploring how formal methods and proof assistants like Lean4 can be used to verify software correctness, especially in building secure and robust machine learning models.

Ultimately, my motivation is to help democratize access to high-quality technical knowledge. This belief has driven me to tutor fellow students, contribute to Wikipedia, and develop open-source tools. I am always eager to contribute a community-focused mindset and advanced technical skills to impactful projects. 🚀

When I'm not "working", you can find me studying 20th century history & political economy, playing (acoustic & electric) guitar 🎸, reading 📚, and writing poetry ✍️.
