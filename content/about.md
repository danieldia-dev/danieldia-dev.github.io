Hello! I'm Daniel Dia 👋

Welcome to my personal corner of the web.

I'm a first-year Computer & Communications Engineering (CCE) and Mathematics dual degree student at the American University of Beirut (AUB).

My passion lies at the intersection of **mathematics**, **cryptography**, and **systems programming**. I'm driven to create software that is not just *functional*, but also verifiably *correct*, *efficient*, and **secure**.

As an energetic and highly motivated person, my central goal is to democratize access to high-quality technical knowledge and help others explore the "why" behind everything. I'm driven by a profound sense of initiative, whether that's tutoring, developing open-source tools, or designing hands-on workshops. I thrive on demystifying complex subjects and making them accessible to a wider audience.

My technical focus is on principled, low-level software engineering. This ranges from embedded systems programming with `C` and `C++` on platforms like the `ESP32`, to exploring foundational systems like the `Linux` kernel, to building modern, memory-safe applications in `Rust`. I'm particularly interested in high-assurance cryptography, using formal methods and tools like `F*`, `Lean4`, `ProVerif`, and `hax` to build provably secure protocols and ensure correct implementation. 🚀

When I'm not "working", you can find me studying 20th century history & political economy, playing (acoustic & electric) guitar 🎸, reading 📚, and writing poetry ✍️.
