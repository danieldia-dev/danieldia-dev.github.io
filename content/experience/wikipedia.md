## Wikipedia & Open Knowledge Contribution

Driven by a core belief that knowledge should be free and accessible to all, I am an active volunteer contributor to Wikipedia, the world's largest open encyclopedia. My work focuses on enhancing the quality, depth, and clarity of technical and academic articles for a global audience.

- Global Impact & Community Recognition
    
    I have performed over **130 significant enhancements** to articles in both English and Russian, which have collectively been viewed by over **1.1 million readers**. This work is not just about adding information, but about making complex topics understandable to a broader audience. Within the collaborative editorial community, my contributions have been recognized with over **70 commendations** ("thanks") from fellow editors, affirming the quality and value of my edits.

- Architecting Knowledge & Technical Expertise

    My primary focus is the comprehensive overhaul of technical content. This often involves more than simple edits; I architect substantial article expansions, sometimes adding over 25,000 characters of well-researched content to a single page. A particular area of expertise is reformatting complex concepts for maximum clarity, especially in mathematics, where I work to translate dense academic notation and theory into **accessible**, **intuitive explanations**.

- Ensuring Quality Across a Broad Scope
    
    I have elevated and significantly expanded core-knowledge articles across a wide range of fields, including **computer science**, **engineering**, **physics**, **biology**, **linguistics**, and **mathematics**. My process involves correcting systemic issues such as sourcing, structure, and neutrality to ensure adherence to the encyclopedia's highest editorial standards. This commitment to quality extends across both the English and Russian platforms.
