My responsibilities and engagement as an active member of the LIFE community include:

* Attending LIFE Academy networking sessions to boost employment opportunities.
* Actively managing a relationship with an assigned mentor to make the most of the guidance provided.
* Participating in volunteering and community engagement opportunities offered by LIFE.
* Committing to becoming a long-term active member of the LIFE network after graduation.
* Pledging to contribute back financially to the scholarship fund in the future to support another scholar.
